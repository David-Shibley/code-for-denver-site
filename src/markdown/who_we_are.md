# Who We Are

Code for Denver is a dedicated, cooperative and diverse group of volunteers. We are dedicated to the creation of civic technology aimed squarely at solving the problems of the world around us.

We are technologists, programmers, visual and graphic designers, product managers, community organizers, students, researchers, developers, uxâ€™ers and geeks. We are mothers and brothers and sisters and citizens. We may not all be coders, but we are all working for a better Denver, a better America, and a better tomorrow.

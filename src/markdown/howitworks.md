# Background Information

#### What does Code for Denver typically do?

We work with non-profits or local government to building apps or websites that serve their needs. Who we work with and what issues we address are determined during first Monday pitch nights.  To stay on top of projects throughout the year, we host weekly meetups to manage things and work on current projects.


#### To what degree is your work influenced by Code for America?
Code for America connects us to the wider civic technology movement. We are a brigade of Code for America Brigade, through them, we are able to learn from other brigades. Our projects are member-driven. We seek inspiration from other brigades and adopt many of the working practices and values of Code for America.
